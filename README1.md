# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

## Project Overview
This project is a multi-page application built using React Native with Expo Router. It follows the given instructions and mocks different screens for a complete user flow.

### What I Have Built

### Splash Screen:

#### 1. I created a splash screen that shows up for 4 seconds when the app starts.

#### 2. After the splash screen, it automatically navigates to the sign-in page.

### Sign-In Page:

#### 1. A simple login page where users can enter their credentials to proceed.

#### 2. I also added a language selection button for better accessibility.

### Number Page(task.tsx):

#### 1. After signing in, thereâ€™s a page to add your phone number .


### OTP Verification Page:

####  Users can choose how they want to receive the OTP:

1. Email

2. WhatsApp

3. SMS

### OTP Input Page:

#### A page to enter the OTP for verification.

#### This checks if the user is authorized to access the app.
