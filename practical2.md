##  Authentication & Authorization with Supabase - Practical Report

I have implemented multiple authentication strategies using Supabase in my React Native application

### 2. Password-Based Login

I created a authentication component that handles both sign-in and sign-up functionality. Ths includes:

#### 1. Input fields for email and password with appropriate validation. 

#### 2. Shows success and error alerts to let users know if the action worked or not.
